## Introduction

This assignment and subsequent phases of the design project are to be created in a markdown notebook. Make sure that your markdown notebook begins with a project title, the names of the contributors, and an introduction to the problem that you are solving.

Create a title for your project.
Write an introduction/background to your project and explain why it matters.
Go metric.

## Proposal

Describe your general plan for solving the problem. Create as much detail about how the steps you will need to take to solve the problem as you can. Taking the time to think about the detailed steps will help you divide up tasks and work efficiently.

Steps:
1. Flow rate calculations
2. Design specifications: velocity gradient, baffle spacing/dimensions, number of expansions needed, optimal ratio of height and spacing, total amount of material (surface area)
2. Cost analysis
3. Fabrication details

### Constraints

Include list of important constraints, trade offs, perceived operator/user specifications, major design alternatives, and comparison of the major design alternatives according to the various constraints that you have identified.
Create a table comparing alternatives and your evaluation of which alternatives are most viable. See the comparison of net velocities and filtration performance of SRSF, RSF, and multistage filters.

The Markdown worksheet should include a method to determine any major design constraints, proposed solution technique(s), analysis, sketches, preliminary design, with extensive documentation. Any equations that you present must be well documented with explanation of how you derived those equations and how you are using those equations.
Explain ALL calculations step by step including why you are doing the calculation.

### Trade Offs

fabrication difficulties

### Operator/User Specifications


### Major Design Alternatives

pipe flocculator vs plates

## References

Include a bibliography and citations to acknowledge use of work by others.
Look ahead to the report requirements and begin working on including those sections.
Spell check before submitting and proofread the entire report.
