This assignment and subsequent phases of the design project are to be created in
a markdown notebook. Make sure that your markdown notebook begins with a project
title, the names of the contributors, and an introduction to the problem that you
are solving.

Create a title for your project.
Write an introduction/background to your project and explain why it matters.


## Introduction/Background

The capital cost of a traditional AguaClara plant is fixed at roughly \$100,000, plus an additional \$8,000 per L/s of plant capacity ([Weber-Shirk, 2019](https://github.com/AguaClara/CEE4540_Master/raw/master/Lectures/In%20Class/AguaClara%20Ecosystem.pptx)). This cost is due to the fact that traditional AguaClara plants are constructed of mostly concrete, which require extensive excavation and on-site construction. The higher the plant capacity, the price per L/s decreases. Thus, traditional AguaClara plants are more cost-efficient for larger communities and often not feasible for serving smaller communities that require flow rates of less than 5 L/s. In order to serve this market of smaller communities, AguaClara designed the PF300, a pre-fabricated 1 L/s plant intended to serve a population of 300 ([Buhl et. al, 2016](https://confluence.cornell.edu/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=333352626&preview=/333352626/335435860/Prefab_Final_Report.pdf)).

AguaClara would like to expand its efforts in serving a range of smaller communities. Thus, we would like to design a range of designs that accommodate for flow rates of 1 to 5 L/s ("plantitas"). In particular, we will be focusing on the design of the sedimentation tank. The current design of the PF300 sedimentation tank consists of two sections of a cylindrical corrugated HDPE pipe welded together at a 30 degree angle:

State the current Design
- background info on current 1 LPS sed tank design

What are the issues/why do we need a new design?
- want to increase capacity of 1 LPS and make it easier to fabricate by altering the design of the sedimentation tank

How would a new design solve these problems?
- new design would be easier to fabricate: having straight sed tank would allow for greater capacity


## General Plan/Steps


### Important Constraints
Include list of important constraints, trade offs, perceived operator/user specifications, major design alternatives, and comparison of the major design alternatives according to the various constraints that you have identified. Create a table comparing alternatives and your evaluation of which alternatives are most viable. See the comparison of net velocities and filtration performance of SRSF, RSF, and multistage filters.
Trade offs

Measure of improvement
  - material amount per liter per second
  - area occupied by plant per liter per second
  - difficulty of construction
  - Cost per liter per second

## Methods

Describe your general plan for solving the problem. Create as much detail about how the steps you will need to take to solve the problem as you can. Taking the time to think about the detailed steps will help you divide up tasks and work efficiently.

### Proposed Solution Techniques

### Analysis
Explain ALL calculations step by step including why you are doing the calculation.
### Preliminary Design

Equations
Go metric.



The Markdown worksheet should include a method to determine any major design constraints, proposed solution technique(s), analysis, sketches, preliminary design, with extensive documentation. Any equations that you present must be well documented with explanation of how you derived those equations and how you are using those equations.
